Analysis: 
- We noticed most of the people order the foods during Afternoon. We can safely reduce the discount if any is given in those hours. In order to prompt the operation.
- On the same premises most of the staff needs to be aligned during these hours.
- Most of the orders came from sao paulo. If the company can try to expand they can easily open new stores in the outskirts of the sou paulo.
- Company needs to further analyse to see why there is so much gap in sales in other states vs sao paulo.
- Looking at the pattern of the instalments. We saw people prefer to opt for a low number of instalments. So, the rate of interest on EMI can be increased because it is not a driving factor.
- Almost all of the people spend on credit cards. People spend on the money they loan from the bank instead of their own.
